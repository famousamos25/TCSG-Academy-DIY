                <p>Subject: Request for New Investigation into Authorized User Account Reporting</p>
                <p>Dear {creditorName.toUpperCase()},</p>

                <p>
                    I am writing to express my concern and frustration regarding the continued appearance of an unauthorized user account on my credit report, which your company has been reporting to the credit bureaus. This account does not reflect my financial activities or obligations, and its presence on my credit report is both inaccurate and misleading.                </p>

                <div className="space-y-0.5">
                    <p className="mb-2">Account Details:</p>
                    <p className="font-bold">{accountName}</p>
                    <p>Account Number: {accountNumber}</p>
                    <p>
                        Account was part of a bankruptcy and Account Rating and Account status should show closed and it does not. Please delete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i Paragraph (5), any information disputed by a consumer or an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or cannot be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall (i) promptly delete.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Given the significant impact this inaccurate report has on my credit score and financial opportunities, I am requesting a detailed explanation of the procedures your company employs to verify the status of authorized user accounts. It is crucial for me to understand the basis on which this account has been linked to my financial profile and reported as such to the credit bureaus.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I strongly believe in the importance of accurate credit reporting and am therefore seeking an immediate investigation into this matter. The persistence of this inaccuracy not only affects my financial well-being but also raises concerns about the reliability of your verification process.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I look forward to your prompt response and a thorough investigation into this issue. It is my hope that we can swiftly resolve this matter, ensuring that my credit report accurately reflects my financial history.
                </p>

                <p>Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.</p>
