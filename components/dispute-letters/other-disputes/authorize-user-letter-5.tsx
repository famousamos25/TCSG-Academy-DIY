                    I am writing to formally dispute the accuracy of the following authorized user account listed on my credit report:
                </p>

                <div className="space-y-0.5">
                    <p className="font-bold">{accountName}</p>
                    <p>Account Number: {accountNumber}</p>
                    <p>
                        Account was part of a bankruptcy and Account Rating and Account status should show closed and it does not. Please delete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under 15 U.S.C. 1681i Paragraph (5), any information disputed by a consumer or an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or cannot be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall (i) promptly delete.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    I am concerned about the handling of the new and pertinent information I provided in my previous dispute. Has this information been taken into consideration during the review process of my complaint?
                    It is essential to address this, as the accuracy of your company's communication with the creditor may be in question. I would like to emphasize that I have never had any affiliation with the mentioned creditor, casting doubt on the validity of this reported account.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, the presence of this inaccurate account on my credit report is detrimentally affecting my ability to access credit. I implore you to take immediate action to rectify this error.
                    Failure to do so will leave me with no option but to escalate my complaints and seek legal counsel to address this matter appropriately.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I trust that you will give this matter the attention it deserves and take the necessary steps to resolve it promptly.
                </p>

                <p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
