				<p>
                I demand verifiable evidence bearing my signature/electronic signature. 
                This letter asserts my consumer rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically Section ยง 605B (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681c-2) and Section ยง 604 (15 U.S.C. ยง 1681b).
                I have contacted the relevant companies and found these actions were initiated without proper validation or original
                documentation from any of the reporting entities.
				</p>

				{/* Account Information */}
				<div className="space-y-0.5">
					<p className="font-medium">{accountName}</p>

					<p>{instruction}</p>

				{/* Request */}
				<div className="space-y-4">
					<p>
                    I understand that you have been sending generic responses 
                    to consumer disputes and challenges, disregarding the specific 
                    information provided. This is illegal, as each case must be addressed individually. My letters were created using widely available software. Failure to process them violates 15 U.S. Code 5 1681i. Delaying based on third-party assistance is not legally justified. If you
                     don&apos;t handle my letters promptly, it indicates intentional disregard for my consumer rights, 
                    leading me to seek legal action through my lawyer.
