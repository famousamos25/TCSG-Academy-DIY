                I am writing to follow up on my previous communication regarding an unauthorized inquiry on my credit report. Despite my efforts to resolve this matter directly with the creditor, the inquiry remains on my report, causing further damage to my credit score.              
                </p>
                <p className="py-1">
                After contacting the creditor and requesting proof of authorization for the inquiry, they failed to provide any documentation demonstrating that I consented to the credit pull. Their lack of response confirms my suspicion that this inquiry was made without my permission.
                </p>
                <p className="py-1">
                  As such, I urge you to take immediate action to remove the unauthorized inquiry from my credit report.

                    I trust that you will act in accordance with the law and take the necessary steps to rectify this issue promptly. Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to receiving confirmation of the removal of the unauthorized inquiry from my credit report.
